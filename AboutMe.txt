Hi, I'm Milena. I am a beginner software tester currently looking for a first role where I can transfer my knowledge into experience. 
I have a passion for identifying glitches, bugs, and defects in software.  I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills, attention to details. I am starting my adventure in the IT industry with the hope of a new opportunities. 
I completed relevant courses in software testing, which provided me with a comprehensive understanding of software testing methodologies and tools. 
I have actively engaged in several volunteer projects organized by Anna Pieciulko- Czyrko with Cherry- IT, that allowed me to apply my testing skills. I have hands-on experience in creating test plans, executing test cases, and identifying and reporting software bugs.

In my free time I create graphics in Canva. Every two weeks my friend organizes reading classes for children in the library. I help her by creating posters for these events.

Recently I started training in running, specifically 'Slow Jogging'. Slow jogging belongs to running training methods and consists of slow running in which small steps are taken. It is slower than traditional jogging or running typically at a speed where you can maintain a conversation comfortably. The goal is to maintain a "niko niko" pace, which means "smile" in Japanese, where you feel comfortable and can sustain a smile, indicating low stress and enjoyment.

I like roller skating too.

I write lyrics and singing.
