Hi, I'm Milena. I am a beginner software tester currently looking for a first role where I can transfer my knowledge into experience. 
I have a passion for identifying glitches, bugs, and defects in software.  I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills, attention to details. I am starting my adventure in the IT industry with the hope of a new opportunities. 
I completed relevant courses in software testing, which provided me with a comprehensive understanding of software testing methodologies and tools. 
I have actively engaged in several volunteer projects organized by Anna Pieciulko- Czyrko with Cherry- IT, that allowed me to apply my testing skills. I have hands-on experience in creating test plans, executing test cases, and identifying and reporting software bugs.

In my free time I create graphics in Canva. Every two weeks my friend organizes reading classes for children in the library. I help her by creating posters for these events.
Recently I started training in running, specifically 'Slow Jogging'. 
I like roller skating too.
